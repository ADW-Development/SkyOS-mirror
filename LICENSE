THANKS A LOT,
graham.

If a skyOS edition, mod etc. uses a different license than this one (i.e. skyOS LUANR (the c and lua edition)), that edition remake etc.'s license will govern that ones's specific files.
if no attrubtion is given, the mods LICENSE WILL BE ASKED (AND IF NEEDED FORCED) TO BE CHANGED.
